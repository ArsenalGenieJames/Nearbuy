Steps to Display Your App in the Browser (Using Forward Ports)
Start PHP Built-in Server
Run this command in your terminal to start a local PHP server:


"php -S 0.0.0.0:8000"
This tells PHP to start a server that's accessible on all network interfaces at port 8000.

Forwarding the Port (8000)

In the GitHub Codespaces window, click on the Ports tab in the bottom panel (if you don‚Äôt see it, press Ctrl+Shift+P and type Ports: Focus on Ports View).

Click on "Port: 8000" if it shows up automatically, or click on the ‚ÄúForward a Port‚Äù button if it's not listed and type 8000.

This will create a URL you can click on to view your app in the browser.

Access Your App

Once the port is forwarded, Codespaces will give you a URL like: https://8000-<your-codespace-id>.githubpreview.dev/

Click the link, and you should see your index.php page displayed!

üìå Important Notes:
Make sure your index.php file is in the root directory of your Codespace (or navigate to its folder before running the php -S command).

If you want to run on a different port (e.g., 8080), just change the command to:

"php -S 0.0.0.0:8080"
Don't forget to forward that port in the Ports tab.
